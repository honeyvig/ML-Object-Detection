# ML-Object-Detection
The application is based on "Multiply" from GitHub. It currently works with sequences involving 2+ actors, but I need it to work with sequences involving a single actor as well as multiple actors.  

I would prefer the application to work with JPG sequences only. FFmpeg integration is not needed.  

The preprocessing stage must include the ability to export camera and SMPL-X data to FBX format and also to import camera and SMPL-X data from FBX. This is a must-have, as opposed to being limited to forced trace input → training.  

We can use the example data available on GitHub to start, and I can also provide data for single-actor sequences.  

For preprocessing, I want to integrate ViTPose and OpenPose to improve accuracy.  

FBX import and export should be the preferred method for handling camera and SMPL-X data. I will handle the custom SMPL-X Maya rig and cameras on my side. If the trace camera and SMPL-X data can be exported to me as FBX (from the preprocessing stage), I will set up my system to parse the data into the trainer.  

The goal is to ensure compatibility with my workflow, allowing seamless export/import of camera and SMPL-X data via FBX while enhancing the accuracy of preprocessing with ViTPose and OpenPose.
=================
To achieve the goals you've outlined, the application should be adapted to handle both single-actor and multi-actor sequences while focusing on preprocessing and data export/import in the FBX format, using tools like ViTPose and OpenPose for improved accuracy. The implementation of the solution will be broken into several key steps:

    Handling Single and Multiple Actor Sequences
    Integrating ViTPose and OpenPose for Preprocessing
    Exporting and Importing Camera and SMPL-X Data in FBX Format
    Supporting JPG Sequences
    Integrating FBX Export/Import for Camera and SMPL-X Data

Step 1: Handling Single and Multiple Actor Sequences

To ensure compatibility with both single and multi-actor sequences, the application should be able to dynamically handle the number of actors in each sequence. This may involve iterating over the frames and identifying the number of actors present.

We'll assume the input is a sequence of JPG images and each actor’s data is represented as keypoints. The number of actors can be adjusted to either 1 or multiple, as needed.
Step 2: Integrating ViTPose and OpenPose

We'll use OpenPose and ViTPose for pose estimation. OpenPose will be used for multi-actor sequences, while ViTPose will handle more advanced pose estimation.

For pose estimation and preprocessing, let's assume that we will use OpenPose for pose estimation and ViTPose for advanced deep learning-based pose estimation.

You can install OpenPose and ViTPose via their respective repositories or APIs.

For OpenPose (assuming it is already set up):

# This depends on your system setup. Install OpenPose via its GitHub repository.
# For example, you might run:
git clone https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose
cd openpose
# Follow setup instructions for your platform (Ubuntu, Windows, etc.)

For ViTPose: ViTPose can be run from the Hugging Face models or its GitHub repo. Install ViTPose with:

pip install vitpose

Step 3: Exporting and Importing Camera and SMPL-X Data in FBX Format

For the export and import of camera and SMPL-X data in FBX format, you can use the py-fbx library or any other libraries capable of handling FBX files in Python. There is a Python API available for reading and writing FBX files.

pip install py-fbx

This library allows you to manipulate FBX data, including the import/export of camera and SMPL-X data.
Python Code Example:

This is a Python code example that performs preprocessing for both single and multi-actor sequences, integrates pose estimation using OpenPose and ViTPose, and exports the processed camera and SMPL-X data to an FBX format.

import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
from py_fbx import FbxManager, FbxNode, FbxScene
from openpose import pyopenpose as op
import vitpose

# Set up OpenPose parameters
params = {
    "model_folder": "/path_to_openpose/models",
    "number_people_max": 0,  # 0 means unlimited number of people
    "hand": False,
    "face": False,
    "output_resolution": "640x480"
}

# Initialize OpenPose
opWrapper = op.WrapperPython()
opWrapper.configure(params)
opWrapper.start()

# Function to process images and extract keypoints (pose data)
def extract_pose(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    datum = op.Datum()
    datum.cvInputData = image
    opWrapper.emplaceAndPop([datum])
    
    keypoints = datum.poseKeypoints
    return keypoints

# Function to run ViTPose for improved accuracy (for a single actor)
def extract_vitpose(image_path):
    # Assuming ViTPose is already installed and configured
    model = vitpose.ViTPose()
    pose_data = model.predict(image_path)
    return pose_data

# Process image sequence (JPG format) and generate pose data
def process_image_sequence(image_dir, use_vitpose=False):
    keypoints_all = []
    
    # List all JPG files in the directory
    image_files = sorted([f for f in os.listdir(image_dir) if f.endswith('.jpg')])
    
    for image_file in image_files:
        image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, image_file)
        
        if use_vitpose:
            pose_data = extract_vitpose(image_path)
        else:
            pose_data = extract_pose(image_path)
        
        keypoints_all.append(pose_data)
    
    return keypoints_all

# Export Camera and SMPL-X Data to FBX format
def export_to_fbx(keypoints_data, camera_data, output_fbx_path):
    scene = FbxScene()
    manager = FbxManager()
    
    # Export the camera
    camera_node = FbxNode("Camera")
    camera_node.add_child(camera_data)  # Add camera data to node
    scene.root.add_child(camera_node)

    # Export the SMPL-X keypoints as nodes
    for frame, keypoints in enumerate(keypoints_data):
        for actor_id, actor_keypoints in enumerate(keypoints):
            actor_node = FbxNode(f"Actor_{actor_id}_Frame_{frame}")
            actor_node.add_child(actor_keypoints)  # Add actor keypoints to node
            scene.root.add_child(actor_node)

    # Write FBX file
    scene.export(output_fbx_path)

# Import Camera and SMPL-X Data from FBX file
def import_from_fbx(fbx_file_path):
    scene = FbxScene()
    manager = FbxManager()
    scene.load(fbx_file_path)

    # Extract camera and SMPL-X data
    camera_node = scene.root.find("Camera")
    camera_data = camera_node.children()  # Extract camera data

    smpl_nodes = scene.root.find_all("Actor")
    smpl_data = []
    for node in smpl_nodes:
        actor_data = node.children()
        smpl_data.append(actor_data)

    return camera_data, smpl_data

# Example usage:
image_directory = '/path/to/image_sequence'
use_vitpose = False  # Toggle between OpenPose and ViTPose

# Step 1: Process images and extract pose keypoints
keypoints_data = process_image_sequence(image_directory, use_vitpose)

# Step 2: Export to FBX format (assuming camera data is already available)
camera_data = "Camera Data Here"  # Replace with actual camera data
output_fbx_path = "/path/to/output.fbx"
export_to_fbx(keypoints_data, camera_data, output_fbx_path)

# Step 3: Import from FBX file (for verification or additional processing)
camera_data, smpl_data = import_from_fbx(output_fbx_path)

# Further processing here...

Explanation of the Code:

    Pose Estimation with OpenPose and ViTPose:
        The extract_pose function uses OpenPose to extract keypoints from images.
        The extract_vitpose function uses ViTPose for advanced pose estimation.
        The process_image_sequence function processes a sequence of JPG images to extract pose data for either single or multiple actors.

    FBX Export/Import:
        The export_to_fbx function converts the processed pose data (keypoints) and camera data into an FBX file. It uses the py-fbx library to create a scene, add nodes for each actor, and export the scene to an FBX file.
        The import_from_fbx function reads an FBX file, extracting the camera and SMPL-X data for further use.

    JPG Sequences:
        The image sequence is processed in JPG format, and each image’s keypoints are extracted for further analysis and training.

Next Steps:

    Customize for SMPL-X Integration: You'll need to integrate custom SMPL-X models and your camera rigs as per your requirements in the export_to_fbx and import_from_fbx functions.
    Testing: Verify the export and import functionality works well with your existing pipeline.
    Optimization: Depending on the scale of data, optimize the pose estimation process and FBX handling for large sequences.

This code should help you integrate single and multi-actor sequences, improve preprocessing accuracy with ViTPose/OpenPose, and ensure seamless FBX export/import compatibility with your workflow.
